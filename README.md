# protocolblocks-uikit

### Replacing delegates in iOS with blocks. (only UIKit)

## Motivation

With iOS 4, Apple introduced [blocks](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/00_Introduction.html) (also known as [closures](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29)) to Objective-C and iOS.

Unfortunately, this leads to [some confusion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3940520/why-does-the-new-ios-gamekit-split-between-delegates-and-blocks), because newer callbacks are implemented as blocks, while older ones are implemented with delegates.

This projects aims to backport blocks for all *old* delegates of iOS.

## Features

* **Easiest usage:**
  only one file to import and one line per object to activate block programming support.
* **No learning curve:**
  thanks to XCode's autocompletion, you don't have to remember block syntax
* **Standard naming:**
  block names are equivalent to protocol method names

## Implementation Status

Currently, blocks have been backported for the following delegates:

* **UIKit**
  * UIAccelerometer delegate
  * UIActionSheet delegate
  * UIAlertView delegate
  * UIDocumentInteractionController delegate
  * UIGestureRecognizer delegate
  * UIImagePickerController delegate
  * UINavigationBar delegate
  * UINavigationController delegate
  * UIPickerView dataSource
  * UIPickerView delegate
  * UIPopoverController delegate
  * UIPrintInteractionController delegate
  * UIScrollView delegate
  * UISearchBar delegate
  * UISearchDisplayController delegate
  * UISplitViewController delegate
  * UITabBarController delegate
  * UITabBar delegate
  * UITableView dataSource
  * UITableView delegate
  * UITextField delegate
  * UITextView delegate
  * UIVideoEditorController delegate
  * UIWebView delegate

## Usage Example

### 1. Import the header

    #import "UIKit+Blocks.h"

### 2. Initialize your object as usual

    UIActionSheet* actionSheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc]
                                   initWithTitle:@"Title"
                                   delegate:nil // no need for self or similar
                                   cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                                   destructiveButtonTitle:@"Destruct"
                                   otherButtonTitles:nil];

### 3. Enable blocks instead of providing a delegate

    [actionSheet useBlocksForDelegate];

The automatically created delegate object is autoreleased thanks to Objective-C's [Associate Reference](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Chapters/ocAssociativeReferences.html) magic.

### 4. Implement delegate methods with blocks

    [actionSheet onCancel:^(UIActionSheet *actionSheet) {
        // your code here
    }];
    [actionSheet onClickedButtonAtIndex:^(UIActionSheet *actionSheet, NSInteger buttonIndex) {
        // your code here
    }];
    [actionSheet onDidDismissWithButtonIndex:^(UIActionSheet *actionSheet, NSInteger buttonIndex) {
        // your code here
    }];
    [actionSheet onDidPresentActionSheet:^(UIActionSheet *actionSheet) {
        // your code here
    }];
    [actionSheet onWillDismissWithButtonIndex:^(UIActionSheet *actionSheet, NSInteger buttonIndex) {
        // your code here
    }];
    [actionSheet onWillPresentActionSheet:^(UIActionSheet *actionSheet) {
        // your code here
    }];
